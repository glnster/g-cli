# g

Simple git branch switcher, heavily based on TJ's [n](https://github.com/tj/n).

## Installation

    $ npm install -g g-cli

or

    $ make install
    
to `$HOME`.

### Switching branches

Type `g` to prompt selection of a local git branch. Use the up / down arrow to navigate, and press right arrow to select, or left arrow to cancel:

You can also use `WASD` instead of arrow keys, `space` or `enter` to submit and `escape` to exit.
